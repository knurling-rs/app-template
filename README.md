# `app-template`

> Quickly set up a [`probe-run`] + [`defmt`] + [`flip-link`] embedded project

[`probe-run`]: https://crates.io/crates/probe-run
[`defmt`]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt
[`flip-link`]: https://github.com/knurling-rs/flip-link

## Dependencies

#### 1. `flip-link`:

```console
$ cargo install flip-link
```

#### 2. The **git** version of `probe-run`:

<!-- TODO: update this once defmt is on crates.io? -->
``` console
$ cargo install \
    --git https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run \
    --branch main \
    --features defmt
```

#### 3. [`cargo-generate`]:

```
$ cargo install cargo-generate
```

[`cargo-generate`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate

> *Note:* You can also just clone this repository instead of using `cargo-generate`, but this involves additional manual adjustments. [This flip-link CI patch](https://github.com/knurling-rs/flip-link/blob/main/.github/workflows/0001-configure-test-flip-link-app-for-nrf52840.patch) can serve as a reference on what to do.

## Setup

#### 1. Initialize the project template

``` console
$ cargo generate \
    --git https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template \
    --branch main \
    --name my-app
```

If you look into your new `my-app` folder, you'll find that there are a few `TODO`s in the files marking the properties you need to set.

Let's walk through them together now.

#### 2. Set `probe-run` chip

Pick a chip from `probe-run --list-chips` and enter it into `.cargo/config.toml`.

If, for example, you have a nRF52840 Development Kit from one of [our workshops], replace `{{chip}}` with `nRF52840_xxAA`.

[our workshops]: https://github.com/ferrous-systems/embedded-trainings-2020

``` diff
 # .cargo/config.toml
 [target.'cfg(all(target_arch = "arm", target_os = "none"))']
-runner = "probe-run --chip {{chip}} --defmt"
+runner = "probe-run --chip nRF52840_xxAA --defmt"
```

#### 3. Adjust the compilation target

In `.cargo/config.toml`, pick the right compilation target for your board.

``` diff
 # .cargo/config.toml
 [build]
-target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+
-# target = "thumbv7m-none-eabi"    # Cortex-M3
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabi"   # Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M7 (no FPU)
-# target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F and Cortex-M7F (with FPU)
+target = "thumbv7em-none-eabihf" # Cortex-M4F (with FPU)
```

### 4. Add a HAL as a dependency

In `Cargo.toml`, list the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for your board as a dependency.

For the nRF52840 you'll want to use the [`nrf52840-hal`].

[`nrf52840-hal`]: https://crates.io/crates/nrf52840-hal

``` diff
 # Cargo.toml
 [dependencies]
-# some-hal = "1.2.3"
+nrf52840-hal = "0.11.0"
```

#### 5. Import your HAL

Now that you have selected a HAL fix the HAL import in `src/lib.rs`

``` diff
 // my-app/src/lib.rs
-// use some_hal as _; // memory layout
+use nrf52840_hal as _; // memory layout
```

#### 6. run!

You are now all set to `cargo-run` your first `defmt`-powered application!
There are some examples in the `src/bin` directory.

Start by `cargo run`-ning `my-app/src/bin/hello.rs`:

``` console
$ # `rb` is an alias for `run --bin`
$ cargo rb hello
    Finished dev [optimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s
flashing program ..
DONE
resetting device
0.000000 INFO Hello, world!
(..)

$ echo $?
0
```
